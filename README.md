# Hello hunters!
Welcome to Monster Hunter World Armor Set Searcher repo.

## About this repo
This repo was created to manage the release of 'Monster Hunter World Armor Set Searcher' project  
that I have worked on few years ago.

## Any plans for update?
When I started this project, there wasn't any 'armor set searcher' tools for the MHW.  
Now, there are plenty of'em with better accessibility, like web-based and whatnot.  
So, there is no plan for me to update this.  

## Source code
Therefore, I opened up the source code repo as the submodule called 'source_code'  
FYI, this project was a short-term project, so the codes are really messy. 

## Comments and questions
If you have any comments to leave or have questions to ask, 
please go to [issues](https://github.com/bsy6766/MHWASS/issues) and open a new issue.
